# About
A cool blog app I use to post about various topics of personal interest.

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: Start by cloning the repository from GitHub to your local machine. You can do this using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/d1joseph/dhivjoseph.dev.git
```

2. `cd` into the project and install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Run the development server: After you have installed the dependencies, you can start the development server using the following command:
```
npm run dev
```

4. Make changes: Once the development server is running, you can make changes to the project code. As you make changes, the development server will automatically reload the page, so you can see your changes in real-time.

5. Test your changes: Once you have made your changes, you should test them to ensure that everything is working as expected. You can do this by running the tests using the following command:
```
npm test
```
