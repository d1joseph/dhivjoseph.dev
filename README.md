# dhivjoseph.dev
First iteration of my personal website.

## About this project

The first iteration of this project is to build a personal and professional website as a programmer and blogger. [dhivjoseph.dev](http://dhivjoseph.dev) is a simple crud application built with flask, bootstrap, html/css/javascript, sqlite and hosted on Digital Ocean cloud services.

The site serves as my personal space on the internet for people to learn about me, my programming adventures and read my blog posts which are reflections of my thoughts and views on a variety of interests ranging from crypto, gaming, art, philosophy, economics, technology and computer science. My end goal is that this site is a place for me to express my ideas and experiments, and for people to share their thoughts in return.

The site will feature a REST API that feeds updates on things I'm working on such as my github repos, development on projects in discord, blockchain and hardware, my World of Warcraft guild and Twitch.

Eventually the site will also showcase my completed projects for people to explore.

People can also contact me via a form if they're interested in discussing freelance work, projects or other opportunities.
